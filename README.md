# myFlix-client

The code will allow for a client interface to be built using REACT.  This will consume the API endpoints created in achievement 2 and enable the data in the various collections to be accessed.

Additional description about the project and its features.

## Built With

- Javascript,
- REACT,
- Redux

## Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://livedemo.com)


## Getting Started
(<npm init>) was used to create a package.json file to allow for dependencies to be added.
A basic template structure was created to test installed REACT dependencies 

Parcel was installed using the <npm install parcel@2.0.0-beta.3.1 -g> command as the init parcel version was not functioning.
Parcel was run and this created a dist folder structure which acts as templates which will be added to later in the achievement.
The folder struture was built on further within the src folder to enable components for movie-cards, movie-views and a main view.
Onclick functionality was added to allow for movie details to be displayed.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

### Setup

### Install

### Usage

### Run tests
Some run tests were made after the Parcel build in order to check the html page was automatically updating when the code changed.  Also to ensure the css file was rendering the index.html page correctly and the information was being displayed. 

The site was then run on a localhost so changes to the DOM could be dynamically visible and the functionality of the event code and views could be tested.

### Deployment
The API is hosted within heroku but the current verion of this client project is only available locally through the parcel tool. Future plans are to host this project using Netlify.
